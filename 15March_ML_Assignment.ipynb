    "The main difference between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning lies in the type of data they use for training:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised Learning: This approach uses labeled datasets for training. These datasets are designed to train or \"supervise\" algorithms into classifying data or predicting outcomes accurately. It can be separated into two types of problems: classification and regression. Classification problems use an algorithm to accurately assign test data into specific categories. Regression uses an algorithm to understand the relationship between dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised Learning: This approach uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets. These algorithms discover hidden patterns in data without the need for human intervention (hence, they are \"unsupervised\"). Unsupervised learning models are used for three main tasks: clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semi-Supervised Learning: This approach resides between supervised and unsupervised learning. It accepts data that's partially labeled or where the majority of the data lacks labels. The ability to work with limited data is a key benefit of semi-supervised learning, because data scientists spend the bulk of their time cleaning and organizing data."

    "Unsupervised learning can be used in anomaly detection by learning what normal behavior is, and then applying a statistical technique to determine if a specific data point is an anomaly. This kind of anomaly detection technique is able to detect any type of anomaly, including ones which have never been seen before. For example, in credit card fraud detection, unsupervised learning can be used to learn the underlying structure of data and help discover hidden patterns in the absence of labels. It can adapt to newly emerging patterns of fraud as quickly as possible. Techniques like One-Class SVM can be used to identify anomalies as an unsupervised problem (in which training data is not labeled)."
